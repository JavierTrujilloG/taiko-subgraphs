# Instant Subgraphs

[Goldsky's Instant Subgraphs](https://docs.goldsky.com/subgraphs/guides/create-a-no-code-subgraph)

Simple JSON config file to index a contract with an ABI.

Here we grab the ABI from [Morph Holesky block explorer](https://explorer-holesky.morphl2.io/token/0x9E12AD42c4E4d2acFBADE01a96446e48e6764B98?tab=contract)

All ERC-20 contracts should use a common ABI. Same is true for ERC-721 and ERC-1155 (though they differ from each other).
